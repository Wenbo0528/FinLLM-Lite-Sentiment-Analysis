Over the years, you may have seen advice in the financial media about the “60/40 portfolio,” which consists of 60% stocks and 40% bonds. This type of portfolio can be put together without too much trouble through the use of mutual funds or exchange-traded funds. But the strong performance for U.S. stocks over the past 15 years, along with low interest rates, has led some investors to build retirement nest eggs that are 100% allocated toward stocks. Conventional wisdom is to reduce your allocation to stocks and increase your exposure to bonds as you get closer to retirement, in order to reduce risk and lean more toward income generation.

Here's what you need to know: NET PROFIT FORECAST: The world's largest contract electronics maker is expected to report a 69% jump in quarterly profit to 37.15 billion new Taiwan dollars, equivalent to $1.23 billion, according to the consensus estimate of 15 analysts in a FactSet poll. The sharp rise is partly due to a low base, as Foxconn's bottom line was hurt by a NT$17.3 billion write-down related to its 34% stake in Japanese electronics maker Sharp in the same period last year. REVENUE FORECAST: The Taiwanese company, formally known as Hon Hai Precision Industry, said first-quarter revenue rose 24% to NT$1.642 trillion, supported by strong AI server demand. Foxconn's shares have declined 17% so far this year after falling 21% in the first quarter. Fears about the U.S. tariffs on Taiwanese goods ahead of \""}}
